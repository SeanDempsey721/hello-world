# hello-world
My first repository
**I'm in the beginning stages of learning how to use GitHub and code GO**
I expect to know how to do the following when I'm done...
1. Create and edit a repository
2. Create and edit new branches in a repository
3. Write/create new GO code
4. Merge new branches (code changes and updates) with the main branch of my repository
main
